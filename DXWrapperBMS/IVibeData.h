/*
landing gear status
wheel brake status
air brakes status
game paused status (when game is not live, we should get a paused signal)
ejection? for this, we can reneder some cool effects
drop bombs?
firing guns?
firing missile? (use the + counter bytes for each type, this is the best
way)
type?
sidewinder
amraam
maverick.. probably more?

exiting the sim (you know the graphical fly by it does when you exit?  for
that we can render a flyby to match the F16 passing the viewer, so if
there's a "distance from viewpoint center" value, that would be great to
know)

For the X,Y,Z coordinates, when having an external view, we can do
some really cool things if we are able to, for example, subtract the values
and come up with the distance from the center of the screen.  Is that
possible?  It's the viewer flyby that will work best, so as the plane
approaces and whizzes by, we can make all the feedback rise and fall exactly
in sync, so it might feel like a real ^16 "buzzed the tower" so to speak...
should be cool, but there's only one way to find out! :)

escape key?
resume sim?

flare dropped?
chaff dropped?  again maybe the +1 byte counters are best?

rpm
yaw
pitch
roll
air speed
takeoff (are we on the ground, off the ground)
roll
gforce (lateral and front to back if you got 'em)
overspeed
weapons
afterburner
